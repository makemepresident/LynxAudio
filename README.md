Website is hosted using Amazon Web Services. We have not obtained a domain name due to budget constraints.

Website uses a 3 tiered system with a Client, WebApp, and API.

 1. The client is responsible for presenting the data to the client
 2. The WebApp is responsible for ensuring data integrity before continuing to API
 3. API is responsible for direct communication with the database.

## How to use
Simply go to the website, sign in with an account (or don't, if you'd like to record anonymously) enter a title for your clip (or don't, we don't judge) and click the big record button. Speak into your microphone, and click the button again to stop recording. Watch it pop out and play as a clip!

If you want to view your recordings. You must have an account and made the recordings while signed into the account. Sign in with your account and click the "My Recordings" tab in the top right. It will load all your recordings. You can also delete old recordings you no longer want from this page.

If you want to view a recording that you didn't create, you can view 5 of the most recent recordings made by signed-in users on the front page of the website, or by the URL someone else may have provided you!

Check to make sure you have the right audio device selected in your computer's audio settings. The app automatically records based off your default audio device.
